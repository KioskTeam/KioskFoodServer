How to run
----------

It's simple go server. If your `GOPATH` is set correctly you
can get it like this:

  $ go get github.com/KioskTeam/KioskFoodServer

And then run it with:

  $ go run $GOPATH/src/github.com/KioskTeam/KioskFoodServer

Or better, setup [docker/fig](http://www.fig.sh/install.html) and then
you can `cd` into source folder and issue `fig up`.
